# Cache directory - where you want to store files, this directory must already exist
# List of places to look for the Cache directory - will check all of them, and they don't need to exist
# Paths can include unix conventions like ~ * . .. etc
# Default is to look in home directory and root of any device (for example a USB) for directories "archiveorg"
directories:
  - ~/archiveorg # Home directory of user
  - /Volumes/*/archiveorg # Any connected volume
  - /media/pi/*/archiveorg # At least on Internet-in-a-Box USB volumes are put here
  - /media/usb*/archiveorg # IIAB v7 seems to put them here via usbmount
  - /.data/archiveorg # This is where Rachel3+ puts its data
  - /library/archiveorg # This is where IIAB wants content
  - /data/archiveorg # Persistent and shared volume on OLIB

bookreader:
  directories: # Note the code uses the first of these found to exist
    - ../bookreader/BookReader # Try a repo cloned to a directory parallel or installed to this one, which is presumably for development

  directories: # Note the code uses the first of these found to exist
    - ../epubreader/reader # Try a repo cloned to a directory parallel or installed to this one, which is presumably for development
    - ../../@futurepress/epubjs-reader/reader # Try repo installed as dependency at same level
    - node_modules/@futurepress/epubjs-reader/reader # Or a repo installed as a dependency via 'yarn install'
