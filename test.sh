  This script is intended to support development and testing of all of the dweb repo's.
  While its not strictly required to, for example dweb-mirror to work on dweb-archive, the simplicity
  of one set of installation instructions, and the advantage of being able to test dweb-archive on dweb-mirror
  makes it preferable.

  This script can be run multiple times without problems.

  The easiest way to run is

  curl -o- -L https://unpkg.com/@internetarchive/dweb-mirror/install_dev.sh | bash

# Note that dweb-transport and dweb-gatewahy are not installed they are only useful when running as a gateway server at the archive.

==== INSTALLATION COMPLETE ==============
All the repos are installed

You can access it for testing on two different servers.

a) dweb-archive, loads the UI locally, but accesses the content via the common dweb.archive.org

  cd dweb-archive/dist
  http-server

  open http://localhost:8080/archive.html

b) dweb-mirror to test the offline mode

  cd dweb-mirror
  ./internetarchive -sc

  open http://localhost:4244

you can make changes in the UI in dweb-archive, iaux/packages/ia-components, bookreader or dweb-archive-controller then

  cd dweb-archive ; webpack --mode development -w &

This will watch for changes so that any edits you make are immediately reflected on either of the servers and testable with a browser page reload

If you make change to dweb-transports:

  cd dweb-transports ; webpack --mode development -w &

If you make changes to dweb-mirror, then ctrl-C out of the server and restart it.
